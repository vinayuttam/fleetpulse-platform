# Fleet Pulse Platform

Real-time IoT Fleet Telemetry Platform

## What is FleetPulse?

FleetPulse aims to provide a scalable, fault-tolerant, real-time telemetry platform for large IoT fleets. 
It enables continuous ingestion, processing, and analysis of high-frequency device signals—such as GPS, battery status, 
temperature, and sensor outputs—from distributed systems like EV chargers, autonomous vehicles, factory robotics,
and cold-chain logistics units.
